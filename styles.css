/* I learned a lot about styling form elements from this project.
  Search input fields are not easily styled, but text fields can be
  styled with css, so I am using a text input instead of a search
  input.  Another issue for me was learning how to hide the text
  input and take it out of the document flow so that the search icon 
  would be centered when the text input is hidden, as well as showing
  a transition for the change. */

  /* I learned about styling form elements and working with hidden
   elements during this project.
     Problem 1: Styling a search input field with css didn't work.  I 
   couldn't change the height, width, or padding to make it the size
   I wanted.
     Solution 1: Text input fields can be styled with css.  I changed
   my search input to a text input, then was able to handle the styling
   I was interested in with css.
     Problem 2: Using visibility: hidden was problematic for two reasons.
   First, hidden elements still use up the space they would use as if they
   are not hidden. I wanted the search icon to move to the middle of the 
   window when the text input was hidden.  The option, display: none, cannot
   use transitions.  I read many articles about hiding elements in various
   ways that affect: 
     a) whether or not the element's invisible space is still shown
     b) whether or not screen readers will read the content
     c) whether or not events can be triggered
     d) whether or not it can be animated with transitions
     e) performance
   In the end, I watched the solution used in the course video and will use the
   same approach, by using other css properties such as size to hide the element
   under the search icon.  */
